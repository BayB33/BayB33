- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom. I'm French.
- 👀 I’m training in web development and programming.
- 🌱 I've started to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and program with C first and then transitioned to Python and Flask.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginners projects to practice what I'm learning, to see how to work on a project from scratch, to see how to work collaboratively 
and also to get to know developpers.

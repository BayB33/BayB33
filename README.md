- 👋 Hi, I’m @BayB33
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning generalities about the web and coding. I've also started to code in JavaScript (in addition with HTML/CSS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginners projects to practice what I'm learning, to see how to work on a project from scratch, to see how to work collaboratively 
and also to get to know developpers.
- 📫 How to reach me : thomasraymond.d@gmail.com
